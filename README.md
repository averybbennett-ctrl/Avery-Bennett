## About Me

I am a third-year Honours Economics student at the University of Waterloo, specializing in Econometrics. My academic journey has been shaped by a deep interest in applying quantitative methods to complex economic questions, combining rigorous statistical analysis with a nuanced understanding of economic theory and history. 

Throughout my undergraduate studies, I have developed a deep interest in microeconomic theory, econometrics, labour economics, and the historical evolution of economic thought, exploring how past policies inform contemporary economic challenges. My coursework and research projects have provided extensive experience in data analysis, regression modeling,  theory application, and research, equipping me with the tools to analyze real-world economic phenomena critically and systematically.

Looking past graduation in 2027, I plan to continue my studies by pursuing a Master’s degree in Economics, with the goal of contributing to research that bridges theoretical insight with practical application.

## Past Projects
**Ontario Minimum Wage Policy Analysis**
- Conducted a comprehensive analysis of Ontario’s minimum wage policy, combining qualitative and quantitative methods to evaluate its social costs, benefits, and stakeholder impacts.  
- Examined historical context, policy evolution, and economic theory, including Efficiency Wage Theory, Neoclassical Theory, and Post-Keynesian Institutional approaches.  
- Used empirical data to assess employment trends, poverty reduction, income distribution, and business performance, highlighting trade-offs between worker protection and economic impact.  
- Findings indicate that while wage increases improve financial security, productivity, and aggregate spending, they pose challenges for small businesses, may lead to job reductions for youth and part-time workers, and require careful policy design to minimize negative externalities.  
- Policy recommendations included gradual, indexed wage increases, targeted support for small businesses, and enhanced social welfare programs to mitigate inequities and improve outcomes.

## Current Projects
**Causal Analysis of Goalie Performance**  
- Investigating the causal effect of workload on productivity in the short-run, using NHL goaltender data from the 2024-2025 season, where labour (input) is measured by the number of starts, back to back games, and days of rest, and output is observed through save percentage and goals against average.
- We will examine how additional starts affect goaltender performance while controlling for individual characteristics, providing evidence on how increased labour generates diminishing returns, as well as explore the ambiguity in how inefficiencies like fatigue may reach a point of generating negative returns.
- Cleaned and analyzed datasets, applying regression and econometric techniques to determine the causal relationship between measures of workload and save percentage.  
- Developed a plm model in R code, with visualizations to summarize findings.
